If your business wants to be able to accept bitcoin, no one can do it faster. A few examples:

*Create an account and share your username as your public URL:*

Create an account on [CoinOS](https://coinos.io) and your username instantly becomes your public URL! So if your username is vancouverrealestate, you can send anyone to https://coinos.io/vancouverrealestate and they can see your Lightning Network (we recommend this!), Bitcoin, and Liquid addresses that they can send money to! That’s the fastest and easiest way to be able to accept bitcoin in less than 20 seconds, simply by creating an account!

You can go from no account to accepting Lightning (Bitcoin) for your business for a specific invoice in under 1 minute:
