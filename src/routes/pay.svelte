					<strong>paid</strong>

			<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Setup a bitcoin wallet</h3>
			<p class="mb-2">
				Bitcoin is open source which means that there are many compatible wallets you can choose
				from and they will all transact on the same network. The instructions below are for the
				coinos wallet but if you want to do some research and use a different wallet that is
				perfectly OK too.
			</p>
			<ul class="space-y-5 list-disc">
				<li>
					Visit <a
						href="https://coinos.io"
						rel="noreferrer"
						class="text-primary bg-black p-1 rounded-md">coinos.io</a
					>
					and tap on the
					<strong>REGISTER NEW ACCOUNT</strong>
					button.
					<img src="/static/register.png" alt="register" class="mt-4 rounded-lg" />
				</li>
				<li>
					Enter a Username and Password into the input fields. <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>
					- remember to write these down so you can access your account again in the future. When ready
					tap on the <strong>REGISTER</strong> button.
					<img src="/static/register-inputs.png" alt="register-inputs" class="mt-4 rounded-lg" />
				</li>
				<li>
					If you would like to secure your account further, you can tap on the
					<strong>SETUP ACCOUNT</strong> button and set a pin and/or 2FA. Otherwise continue to the next
					step.
				</li>

				<li>
					Tap on the <strong>RECEIVE A PAYMENT</strong> button.
					<img src="/static/receive.png" alt="receive" class="mt-4 rounded-lg" />
				</li>
				<li>
					There are 2 main options for receiving bitcoin into your wallet, each is represented by
					the
					<strong>BITCOIN</strong> and <strong>LIGHTNING</strong> tabs.
					<img src="/static/layer-options.png" alt="layer-options" class="my-4 rounded-lg" /> Which
					method you use depends on the wallet that you are sending from. If that wallet gives you
					the option then use <strong>LIGHTNING</strong>, otherwise <strong>BITCOIN</strong> will
					also work. In either case you can tap on the <strong>SHOW QR</strong> button to easily
					scan the payment information, or you can copy the displayed text and paste it into the
					sending wallet. If you are using the <strong>LIGHTNING</strong> method then you will need
					to tap on the
					<strong>AMOUNT</strong>
					button and enter the amount you wish to receive.
					<img src="/static/amount.png" alt="amount" class="mt-4 rounded-lg" />
				</li>
				<li>
					The default units for receiving on <strong>LIGHTNING</strong> are <strong>SAT</strong>
					(satoshis) which are smaller units of bitcoin. You can toggle and switch to
					<strong>BTC</strong>
					if you would like.
					<img src="/static/units-sat.png" alt="units" class="mt-4 rounded-lg" />
				</li>
				<li>
					Once you have entered the correct amount, tap on the <strong>DONE</strong> button.
					<img src="/static/enter-amount-sat.png" alt="enter-amount" class="mt-4 rounded-lg" />
				</li>
				<li>
					This is how the display will look if you choose to scan a QR code. Simply scan this code
					with the device you are using to send the bitcoin.
					<img src="/static/show-qr.png" alt="show-qr" class="mt-4 rounded-lg" />
					<img src="/static/qr-sat.png" alt="qr" class="my-4 rounded-lg" />
					You should now have bitcoin in your coinos wallet and are ready to go out and spend it!

			<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Spend those sats</h3>
			<p class="mb-2">
				When at a store that accepts bitcoin they will display a QR code for you to scan at
				checkout. You can follow these simple steps to complete the payment.
			</p>
			<ul class="space-y-5 list-disc">
				<li>Open your coinos wallet and tap on the <strong>SCAN</strong> button.</li>
				<img src="/static/scan.png" alt="scan" class="mt-4 rounded-lg" />
				<li>
					Scan the QR code and the sale amount will be added automatically to your wallet and ready
					to send.
				</li>
				<img src="/static/pay.png" alt="payment" class="mt-4 rounded-lg" />
				<li>
					Tap on the <strong>SEND</strong> button to complete the payment. You can optionally add a memo
					for yourself to track your purchases.

				You are now part of the <strong>bitcoin circular economy</strong>, you can go and tell all
				your friends how cool that is! <br /><br /> The coinos wallet is suitable for daily spending
				and storing smaller amounts of bitcoin. It is recommended for larger amounts and for
				long-term storage to withdraw your bitcoin from the coinos platform and put them onto a
				<strong>hardware wallet</strong>. A few options for trusted hardware wallets can be found
				below.
