You've likely heard of non-fungible tokens or NFTs over the last year, and most of these NFTs are based on Ethererum, or [ERC-721](http://erc721.org/) tokens more specifically. One of the challenges of using this technology in the NFT space is that the Ethereum transaction fees, otherwise known as gas or gei fees, are extraordinarily high right now. It's not uncommon for the cost of adding a piece of art as an NFT, or "minting" it, to go upwards of $50.00 USD per art piece or NFT, making the technology unapproachable to most.

Enter [Liquid Network](https://liquid.net/), an innovative product from [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com/liquid/). Amongst other features, liquid allow for the issuance of digital assets. When we saw the opportunity for this technology to be used for bitcoin, we integrated it into our platform, and as of writing this we're still the officially listed [web wallet](https://help.blockstream.com/hc/en-us/articles/900000633526-Where-can-I-get-a-Liquid-wallet-) if you want to manage Liquid or L-BTC.
